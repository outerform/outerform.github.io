Research Interest
======
My research interest is in the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which aims to develop machine learning and deep learning techniques that are transparent, interpretable, and explainable to humans. Specifically, I am interested in developing XAI techniques that can enhance human understanding, trust, and decision-making in complex AI systems, such as those used in healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles. My research also explores the ethical and social implications of XAI, such as fairness, accountability, and transparency. Through my work, I hope to contribute to the development of XAI as a critical component of AI systems that can be trusted and understood by humans.
