  Hello! Welcome to my homepage. I am <ruby>Liu<rt>surname</rt></ruby> <ruby>Junhao<rt>first name</rt></ruby> (<ruby>刘俊豪<rt>liú jùn háo</rt></ruby>), a 4-th year PhD student in the <a href = "https://pl.cs.pku.edu.cn">Programming Language Lab</a> at Peking University, advised with <a href="https://xinpl.github.io/">Prof. Zhang Xin</a> .
</p>


<p>
  My research interests lie in the field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which focuses on developing machine learning and deep learning techniques that are transparent, interpretable, and understandable to humans. I am particularly interested in creating XAI methods that enhance human understanding and trust, and help people effectively utilize AI systems in real-world applications.
</p>

<!-- <p>
<strong>I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. and am exploring opportunities to participate as an exchange student. This experience will provide valuable academic and cultural exposure to further enhance my research in explainable AI. If you have any opportunities or suggestions, feel free to reach out.</strong>

  I was previously active in competitive programming, having earned several gold medals in the ICPC Asia-East Continental Final and Regional Contests. I also won a gold medal in the National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI) in 2017. Additionally, I am a co-founder of the PKU Student Algorithm Association.

<p>
  In my spare time, I enjoy sim racing and am an fan of the Formula 1 racing series—especially the Scuderia Ferrari team (tifosi). I'm hoping to see them win the championship in <s>2025</s>2026.

The most important lesson learned in programming language lab is to learn more languages. 
除咗英文同普通話，我亦學緊粵語，咁我哋都可以用一齊練習粵語。
<!-- 我亦懂得啲粵語，咁我哋都可以用粵語進行學術交流。 -->
<!-- 日本語でもいい。 -->
