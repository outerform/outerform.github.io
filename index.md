  Hello! Welcome to my homepage. I am <ruby>Liu<rt>surname</rt></ruby> <ruby>Junhao<rt>first name</rt></ruby> (<ruby>刘俊豪<rt>liú jùn háo</rt></ruby>), a PhD student in the <a href = "https://pl.cs.pku.edu.cn">Programming Language Lab</a> at Peking University, advised with <a href="https://xinpl.github.io/">Prof. Xin Zhang</a> .
</p>

<p>
  My research interests lie in the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which focuses on developing machine learning and deep learning techniques that are transparent, interpretable, and understandable to humans. I am particularly interested in creating XAI methods that enhance human understanding, foster trust, and support decision-making in complex AI systems.
</p>

  I was previously active in competitive programming, having earned several gold medals in the ICPC Asia-East Continental Final and Regional Contests. I also won a gold medal in the National Olympiad in Informatics in 2017. Additionally, I am a co-founder of the PKU Student Algorithm Association.
</p>

<p>
  In my spare time, I enjoy sim racing and am an fan of the Formula 1 racing series—especially the Scuderia Ferrari team (tifosi). I'm hoping to see them win the championship in <s>2025</s>2026.

<p>
The most important lesson learned in programming language lab is to learn more languages. 
除咗英文同普通話，我亦懂得啲粵語，咁我哋都可以用粵語進行學術交流。
日本語でもいい。
